[What is it?](https://github.com/MarcusMadland/mapp)
-------------------------------------------------------------

MAPP is a cross platform application library that will take care of os tasks to create window, events, and input. It also takes care of basic application structure such as a application class and a layerstack. It's light weight and does nothing more or nothing less than whats stated above.

Supported platforms:

 * Windows (Win32)
 * MacOS (cocoa)
 * Linux 
 * Android 
 * IOS
